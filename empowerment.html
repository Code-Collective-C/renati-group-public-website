                  <h1>Empowerment</h1>
                    <p>
                  At the  Renati Group, we believe a company can only be as <strong>strong</strong> and successful  as its <strong>employees</strong>. Through their <strong>commitment</strong> and dedication,  business <strong>excellence</strong> is maintained and company <strong>growth</strong> can be  achieved.</p>
                    <p>Since  inception, <strong>group policy</strong> has been that <strong>all</strong> employees, regardless  of <strong>job title</strong> or <strong>position</strong>, share in the monthly <strong>profits</strong> of  their respective company. The <strong>Zivuse Trust </strong>was established to provide <strong>employees</strong> of the Renati Group and its subsidiaries with an <strong>investment vehicle</strong> to  further share in the Group&rsquo;s <strong>income</strong> and <strong>capital growth</strong>. It is the  Trust&rsquo;s <strong>mandate</strong> to ensure all employees make <strong>adequate</strong> provision  for retirement and have the means to provide an <strong>education</strong> to their  children. </p>
                    <p>Management is <strong>confident</strong> that the Zivuse Trust will  play an <strong>integral</strong> role in the future <strong>growth </strong>of the Renati Group  and provide great, <strong>long-term</strong> financial benefits and <strong>security</strong> for  Renati Group employees.</p>
