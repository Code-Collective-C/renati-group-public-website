                    <p>The  Renati Group was established in <strong>2014</strong> with the intention of making a <strong>difference</strong> in the petroleum industry by introducing a more <strong>personal</strong> and <strong>technology-driven</strong> way of doing business through a <strong>range</strong> of <strong>unique</strong> product  offerings.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>three</strong> companies launched at the <strong>inception</strong> of the Renati Group were:<br>
                      <br>
  <strong style="color: #F57321">TruckFuelNet</strong>: Specialising in providing a  complete <strong>on-road refuelling</strong> solution driven by <strong>technology</strong>, giving  customers the ability to not only refuel at <strong>discounted prices</strong> but also  manage their <strong>fuel expenditure</strong> on a <strong>real-time basis</strong> through a  comprehensive <strong>management system</strong>.<br>
                      <br>

                  <h3>The present</h3>
                    <p>
                  Since  2014, the Renati Group has <strong>expanded</strong>, adding another company, <strong>Bauzer</strong>,  to the Group. Bauzer  was established with a <strong>vision</strong> to change the way <strong>fuel is traded</strong> in  the South African market. Using knowledge gained over <strong>many years</strong> and  applying a new way of <strong>thinking</strong>, Bauzer&rsquo;s goal is to become the preferred <strong>marketplace</strong> for buying and selling wholesale fuel in South Africa,  through its modern, advanced and fully-integrated <strong>fuel trading</strong> platform.<br><br>
                  Within <strong>five years</strong> the three original companies have grown to become <strong>leaders</strong> and <strong>major players</strong> in their respective fields.<br><br>
                  With  its <strong>120 depots</strong>, TruckFuelNet is South Africa&rsquo;s <strong>largest</strong> independent commercial on-road <strong>refuelling network</strong>, servicing customers  across Southern Africa in excess of <strong>16 million litres</strong> per month. The  company processes over <strong>50,000 </strong>customer transactions <strong>per month</strong> through its <strong>closed-loop</strong> transaction processing system! With its new <strong>fleetcard</strong>,  TruckFuelNet is again leading the market. This <strong>innovative</strong> solution  replaces a physical card with <strong>smartphone technology</strong> to allow  transporters to <strong>manage</strong> their <strong>on-road fuel </strong>expenses, for absolute, <strong>real-time</strong> control over <strong>spending</strong> and <strong>administration</strong> of  driver on-road expenses.     <br><br>
                  With  its <strong>loyal</strong> customer base, Nito has been able to maintain its <strong>wholesale</strong> volumes of over <strong>six million</strong> litres per month. <br><br>
                  Over  and above its work for the Renati Group, Code Collective has developed <strong>successful  software solutions</strong> in the Medical, FMCG and Residential Estate  sectors.  <br><br>
                  With a <strong>combined</strong> annual volume of <strong>over 300 million litres</strong>, the Renati  Group has established itself as one of the <strong>top three</strong> independent  companies in the petroleum industry in South Africa. </p>
